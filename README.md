Woah, look who it is. Someone unlucky enough to stumble upon this page. 
Look, I have no idea what you're here for. There really shouldn't be anything interesting here. How you even managed to reach this place is out of my wildest imaginations. 
Why are you still here. Just leave already. Go watch some youtube shorts or something. Or if you don't enjoy rotting your brain with it, read a book i guess.
Speaking of books, why don't you try this LN that i've been reading for the past months. it's called "Mushoku Tensei". If you're not a fan of anime culture though, just leave. Really.
